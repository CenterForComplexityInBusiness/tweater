long-term Twitter search queries. TwEater supports a variety of backends, from 
flat files to MySQL databases, and it's easy to plug in your own storage code.

KNOWN ISSUES:

-There is a bug in Java release 6u29 (and some versions of 7.x); it contains a 
broken version of rmiregistry that doesn't recogize codebase commands with 
file:/ parameters. This will manifest as an exception when running TwEater that 
says "access to class loader denied". The only known fix is to update to a more 
recent version of Java.
