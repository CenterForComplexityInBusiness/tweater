CSV INSTALLATION AND USE

To generate a default TwEater configuration file, run:

$ ./tweater prop > tweater.properties

Log in to Twitter using a web browser on the local machine. Then run the following:

$ ./setup tweater.properties

This will prompt you to authorize the TwEater application with your Twitter account, and will save an access token to use with your account in the future.

To define the queries you want to use, edit the file "query.csv" per the instructions in the file and in QUERY.README.

If you want to receive an email notification if the TwEater application dies, edit the files "email" and "smtp" which define your email address and a mail server from which you can send email, respectively. For this to work, you need to be able to send mail from this machine with the "mail" command.

You'll be on your way after you run:

$ ./tweater start tweater.properties &

Take a look at the most recent tweater.log.* directly after this command. It should show you the current query. Whenever the query changes, the new query will get printed to this file (and it will also show additions/deletions from the previous query). This file will also contain a log of any errors that occur.

Now that data collection has begun, you can keep track of what's happening using:

$ ./tweater list

This will show the list of running TwEater instances, the names of their log files, the number of tweets they have queued for processing, and the percentage of their available resources that each is using. The numbers in the left column of this list are used to refer to a specific TwEater instance at the command line. For example:

$ ./tweater stop 1

This will instruct the first running TwEater instance to stop collecting data (though it will continue to process and save tweets that it already has queued; when the queue is empty the process will exit and will be removed from the output of the "list" command).
