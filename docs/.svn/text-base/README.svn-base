QUICK START

First, you need to choose what kind of backend you want to use to store tweets.

For smaller data collections that don't require much in the way of searching, subsetting, or statistical analysis, a CSV file works just fine. Check out the file CSV.README if you want to use a flat CSV file as your backend.

For larger data collections, or ones that require the full selection power of SQL, tweets can be stored in a database of an existing MySQL installation. Check out the file MYSQL.README if you're planning to use a MySQL backend.



ADVANCED

See FINDER.README for instructions on using the hole-filling script in case of an outage during your data collection.
