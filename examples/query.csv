# TO START:
# Copy this file from the "examples" directory into the main TwEater directory (the one where the
# "tweater" script lives); you should edit that copy to define your query.
#
# FORMAT:
# start_time, end_time, type, query
#
# TIPS:
# Three types of query: exact phrase, keywords anywhere, or user tracking.
# See file QUERY.README for instructions on good query-building.
# Total phrase and keyword length limit (per line) is 60 characters.
# You can have a total of 400 combined phrase and keyword lines active at a time.
# You can have up to 5000 user lines active at a time.
# If you need to find someone's user ID, see: http://idfromuser.com/.
# Check the latest tweater.log.* file when your query goes live, and it should show you the current
#   query sent to Twitter and also the changes to that query from the previous query.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# 1pm, 5pm, phrase, thinkgeek rules my soul
